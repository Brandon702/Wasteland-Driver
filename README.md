# Wasteland-Driver
A singleplayer wasteland survival run &amp; gun game

This game started as a quarter long school assignment, however I was disappointed with he final product, leading me to decide to keep working on it

This game is a single player run & gun game, set in a post apocolpytic location, the world may seem nice & green at first, but the further you
travel, the worse the world becomes & the harder it is to survive against the unrelenting hordes of zombies, gargoyles, cheetahs, wranglers, & 
blobs of flesh.
